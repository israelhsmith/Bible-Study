		<h3>Scripture (NIV)</h3>
			<p>If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people? Or do you not know that the Lord's people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? Do you know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church? I say this to shame you. Is it possibel that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? But instead, one brother takes another to court -- and this in front of unbelievers!</p>
			<p>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be decieved: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
			<p>"I have the right to do anything", you say -- but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything" -- but I will not be mastered by anything. You say, "Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both." The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh." But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.</p>
			<p>Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.<p>

		<h3>Synopsis</h3>
			<p>In this excerpt from the letter written by Paul to the Church of Corinth, the apostle outlines and details several aspects of the church's ongoings that are not 'up to code' with what Jesus taught. He proceeds to explain how disputes should be settled, who and what the body is meant for, and the consequences of sexually immorality.</p>
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>The first part of the chapter is important because it speaks about what to do in cases of disagreement between believers. It says to solve issues amongst themselves as opposed to settling in the courts of those who do not believe in God. I imagined this stemmed from the quarrles that the church in Corinth was having and how Paul found out about this and felt the need to address it in his letter. The concept of settling arguments amongst your own is the backbone do to many cultures and societies. When there was an issue it was brought before an elder or council that resided within the community that he, she, or they presided over. It was an integral part of the community structure that kept laws and rights intact. This idea of self government between people is based on many important principles. One of which is the fact that in order to stand for a cause or belief one must be apart of a unified front. Fragmentation between believers is the means to an end for any struggle and being able to settle disputes with consistent justice and fairness is the hallmark of a civilized culture or society.</p>
			<p>The second part of the chapter speaks on the behavior of the individual. Whether it be stealing, adultery, slander, or any other number of crimes, it is not only wrong in God's eyes, but it is detrimental to the health of the community. Crime and wrongdoing were the reason the integral structures like councils and courts were established, but the most effective of these structures were the ones based in the community, like the ones explained in the latter paragraph. The act of sinning against your brother has reprocussions beyond the simple committing of a crime, it was indicative of a wrong way of life as well. Changing habits was, and still is, integral in righting the wrongs committed by an individual.</p>
