            <h3>Scripture (NIV)</h3>
            <h4>The Beginning</h4>
            <p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>
            <p>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light 'day', and the darkness he called 'night'. And there was evening, and there was morning - the first day.</p>
            <p>And God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water." So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault "sky". And there was evening, and there was morning - the second day.</p>
            <p>And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so. God called the dry ground 'land', and the gathered waters he called 'seas'. And God saw that it was good.</p>
            <p>Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it acording to  their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the third day.</p>
            <p>And God said, "Let the wate teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky." So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and siad, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." And ther was evening, and there was morning - the fifth day.</p>
            <p>And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according t o its kind." And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</p>
            <p>Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."</p>
            <p>So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and femal he created them.</p>
            <p>God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground."</p>
            <p>Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that mvoe along the ground - everything that has the breath of life in it - I give every green plant for food." And it was so.</p>
            <p>God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the sixth day.</p>

		<h3>Synopsis</h3>
			<p>Genesis 1 details the creation of the world from the creation of the heavens and earth to the creation of mankind. The book of Genesis is attributed to Moses.</p>
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>The book of Genesis is all about the beginning of the some of the most fundamental themes and ideas that are reiterated throughout the bible. Chapter one is no exception. From the very start, this narrative has all the elements of a creation story from the creator to the actual creation. It is read with the goal of understanding the very beginning of 'life'. God's awesome power to make and do good is displayed with the making of the heavens and the earth. Just like a video game developer when first making a new world to explore and thrive in, God first sets the backdrop in which all life will live. He then goes on to create the environment which will house and provide for the life that exists there. After that he actually begins to create life. From the plants to the animals all living things find their own homes in this new world, just like the NPCs in a video game. Once the NPCs are made, God goes on to create the characters in this cosmic video game, which will populate the earth and live alongside all the life that has been created up until this point. After creating man he provides it with all that the earth has to offer, which all takes place on the sixth day.</p>
